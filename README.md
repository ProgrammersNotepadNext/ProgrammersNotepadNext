# ProgrammersNotepadNext
So I have to admit, I love Programmer's Notepad 2. As a simple editor it does one thing very well. It allows for quick file edits. But its no longer maintained and developed. So this is my attempt at creating something similar for my personal usages.

Although the goal is pretty simple, recreate a text/code editor with all the features I like from programmers notepad. Most likely it is going to take me a long time
